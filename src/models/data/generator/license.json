One will be for the server bundle, one for the browser bundle.\n\n#### Options\n\nTo disable automatically opening the report in your default browser, set `openAnalyzer` to false:\n\n```js\nconst withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({\n  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',\n  openAnalyzer: false,\n})\nmodule.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({})\n```\n\n### Usage with next-compose-plugins\n\nFrom version 2.0.0 of next-compose-plugins you need to call bundle-analyzer in this way to work\n\n```js\nconst withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')\nconst withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({\n  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',\n})\n\nmodule.exports = withPlugins([\n  [withBundleAnalyzer],\n  // your other plugins here\n])\n```\n",

(Note that locally, per project, is strongly preferred)\n\n```sh\n$ npm install eslint --save-dev\n```\n\nIf you installed `ESLint` globally, you have to install this plugin globally too. Otherwise, install it locally.\n\n```sh\n$ npm install eslint-plugin-no-relative-import-paths --save-dev\n```\n\n# Configuration\n\nAdd the plugin to the plugins section, and configure the rule options.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"no-relative-import-paths\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"no-relative-import-paths/no-relative-import-paths\": [\n      \"warn\",\n      { \"allowSameFolder\": true }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Rule options\n\n```json\n...\n\"no-relative-import-paths/no-relative-import-paths\": [\n  \"warn\",\n  { \"allowSameFolder\": true, \"rootDir\": \"src\", \"prefix\": \"\" }\n]\n...\n```\n\n- `enabled`: for enabling the rule. 0=off, 1=warn, 2=error. Defaults to 0.\n- `ignorePureComponents`: optional boolean set to `true` to allow relative import paths for imported files from the same folder (default to `false`).\n\n### `allowSameFolder`\n\nWhen `true` the rule will ignore relative import paths for imported files from the same folder\n\nExamples of code for this rule:\n\n```js\n// when true this will be ignored\n// when false this will generate a warning\nimport Something from \"./something\";\n\n// will always generate a warning\nimport Something from \"../modules/something\";\n```\n\n### `rootDir`\n\nUseful when auto-fixing and the rootDir should not be included in the absolute path.\n\nExamples of code for this rule:\n\n```js\n// when not configured:\nimport Something from \"../../components/something\";\n\n// will result in\nimport Something from \"src/components/something\";\n```\n\n```js\n// when configured as { \"rootDir\": \"src\" }\nimport Something from \"../../components/something\";\n\n// will result in\nimport Something from \"components/something\";\n//                     ^- no 'src/' prefix is added\n```\n\n### `prefix`\n\nUseful when auto-fixing and a prefix should be included in the absolute path.\n\nExamples of code for this rule:\n\n```js\n// when not configured:\nimport Something from \"../../components/something\";\n\n// will result in\nimport Something from \"src/components/something\";\n```\n\n```js\n// when configured as { \"prefix\": \"@\" }\nimport Something from \"../../components/something\";\n\n// will result in\nimport Something from \"@/components/something\";\n```",

    "licenseNote": "# eslint-plugin-unused-imports\n\nFind and remove unused es6 module imports. It works by splitting up the `no-unused-vars` rule depending on it being an import statement in the AST and providing an autofix rule to remove the nodes if they are imports. This plugin composes the rule `no-unused-vars` of either the typescript or js plugin so be aware that the other plugins needs to be installed and reporting correctly for this to do so.\n\n## _Important for version 1.1_\n\nThe `-ts` rules are deprecated, the package now looks for `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to exist to decide between the typescript and eslint version.\nThe `-ts` rule will still work, but point to the new rule instead.\n\n## Typescript\n\nIf running typescript with [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) make sure to use both `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser`.\n\n## React\n\nIf writing react code you need to install `eslint-plugin-react` and enable the two rules `react/jsx-uses-react` and `react/jsx-uses-vars`. Otherwise all imports for components will be reported unused.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org) (and [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) if using typescript):\n\n```bash\nnpm i eslint --save-dev\n```\n\nNext, install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install eslint-plugin-unused-imports --save-dev\n```\n\n**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` globally.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `unused-imports` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"plugins\": [\"unused-imports\"]\n}\n```\n\nThen configure the rules you want to use under the rules section. I can recommend adding a check for underscores, e.g.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"rules\": {\n\t\t\"no-unused-vars\": \"off\", // or \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-imports\": \"error\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-vars\": [\n\t\t\t\"warn\",\n\t\t\t{ \"vars\": \"all\", \"varsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\", \"args\": \"after-used\", \"argsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\" }\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Supported Rules\n\n- `no-unused-imports`\n- `no-unused-vars`\n",

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
